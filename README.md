# Coder's Cuisine

## Description

Coder's Cuisine is a website designed for people that have specific dietary restrictions or items at home that they want to use and need a new recipe! This website gives people more variety for the ingredients they usually use at home without having to make an extra trip to the grocery store.

## Usage

Our team used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap with the 2 APIs used below to run our website.

2 APIs used:
- [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) - nutrition and recipe API 
- [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/features) - weather API

Screenshots of finished website:


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## User Story
